# Hephaestus Development Status

## Current State (April 14, 2025)

The Hephaestus UI has been redesigned with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. We've moved away from complex frameworks like React to a vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS approach.

### Completed Work

1. **Basic UI Framework**
   - Created a clean left panel for navigation with component selection
   - Implemented a main content area that supports both terminal and HTML interfaces
   - Added a header for component titles and controls
   - Implemented a footer area with chat input
   - Built a dark theme with consistent styling

2. **Component Interface System**
   - Established a pattern for component UIs to integrate with the main UI
   - Created a sample Ergon component UI with tabs for different functions
   - Implemented the mechanism for switching between components

3. **Global Services**
   - Added localStorage for state persistence
   - Implemented WebSocket-based communication (with fallback for demo mode)
   - Created system for status indicators and notifications

### Current Component Implementation

- **Ergon Component**
  - Created a tabbed interface with Agents, Memory, Tools, and Settings tabs
  - Implemented agent cards with status indicators
  - Built forms for creating new agents
  - Added memory visualization interface
  - Created tools browser with categories
  - Implemented settings configuration interface

## Next Steps

### 1. Component Library Enhancements

- Implement the remaining core components:
  - Tekton - Projects (Dashboard for all projects)
  - Prometheus - Planning (Planning and roadmap visualization)
  - Telos - Requirements (Requirements management)
  - Others as needed

### 2. Terminal Integration

- Enhance the terminal component to properly:
  - Process commands
  - Display results
  - Maintain command history per-component
  - Support typewriter effect for AI responses

### 3. WebSocket Real Implementation

- Replace the demo mode with actual WebSocket communication
- Implement proper message protocols for each component
- Add error handling and reconnection logic

### 4. Additional Features

- Implement keyboard shortcuts
- Add search functionality across components
- Create proper authentication system
- Implement saving and loading of component states

### 5. Styling Enhancements

- Add light theme with smooth transitions
- Implement responsive design for smaller screens
- Create component-specific themes
- Add animations for smoother interaction

```

### Component Integration Pattern

New components should follow this integration pattern:

1. Create an HTML template file in the `components/` directory
2. Add component-specific CSS in the `styles/` directory
3. Create a JavaScript file in the `scripts/` directory that:
   - Registers the component with the UI system
   - Handles component initialization
   - Manages component state
   - Communicates with the backend via WebSocket
4. Add the component to the navigation in `index.html`
5. Link the CSS and JavaScript files in `index.html`

See the Ergon component implementation as a reference.

## Technical Details

### WebSocket Message Format

```json
{
  "type": "MESSAGE_TYPE",      // COMMAND, RESPONSE, UPDATE, NOTIFICATION, ERROR
  "source": "COMPONENT_ID",    // Component sending the message or "UI"
  "target": "COMPONENT_ID",    // Component receiving the message or "UI"
  "timestamp": "ISO_DATE",     // ISO format timestamp
  "payload": {                 // Message-specific content
    // Varies by message type
  }
}
```

### Status Indicators

Components can update their status indicators in the left panel:

- `.active` - Green indicator for active/ready status
- `.attention` - Orange indicator for attention needed
- `.alert` - Red pulsing indicator for urgent matters

### Component Lifecycle

1. **Initialization**:
   - User clicks on component in left panel
   - Component UI is loaded into the main panel
   - Component requests initial state from backend

2. **Operation**:
   - Component processes user interactions
   - Component communicates with backend via WebSocket
   - Backend updates component state

3. **Deactivation**:
   - User switches to another component
   - Component state is saved to localStorage
   - Component UI is unloaded from main panel

## Development Guide

To add a new component:

1. Create the HTML template following the Ergon example
2. Create the component's CSS file with appropriate styling
3. Create the component's JavaScript file with required lifecycle methods
4. Add the component to the navigation in index.html
5. Test the component by accessing the UI and clicking on the component

## Testing

To test the UI, run the server:

```bash
cd /Users/cskoons/projects/github/Tekton/Hephaestus
./run_ui.sh
```

Then access the UI at: http://localhost:8080

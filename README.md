# Hephaestus

Hephaestus is the UI component for the Tekton system. This is a complete redesign focusing on simplicity and ease of maintenance.

## Purpose

The Hephaestus component provides a unified user interface for interacting with all Tekton system components. It serves as the main dashboard and control center for the entire system.

## Development Status

Implementation is in progress. The redesign uses a simpler architecture with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS instead of complex frameworks.

Current status:
- ✅ Core UI framework implemented
- ✅ Basic component integration pattern established
- ✅ Sample Ergon component UI implemented
- ⏳ Other component UIs to be implemented
- ⏳ WebSocket backend integration to be completed

**See [DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md](./DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md) for detailed information about current progress and next steps.**

## Architecture

- **Simple HTML/CSS/JS**: No complex frameworks or build systems
- **Component-based**: Each Tekton component has its own UI module
- **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time updates from backend services
- **Persistent State**: Client-side storage for user preferences and context

## Integration Points

- Connects with Hermes for service discovery
- Provides UI interfaces for all Tekton components
- Visualizes system status and component health
- Uses WebSockets for real-time communication

## Running the UI

```bash
# Start the UI server on port 8080
./run_ui.sh

# Access the UI in your browser
# http://localhost:8080
```

## Adding New Components

Follow the pattern established by the Ergon component:

1. Create an HTML template in `/ui/components/`
2. Add CSS styling in `/ui/styles/`
3. Implement JavaScript functionality in `/ui/scripts/`
4. Add component to the navigation in `index.html`

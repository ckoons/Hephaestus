# Ergon Component Tab Switching Fixes

## Issue Description
The tab switching functionality in the Ergon component wasn't working properly. When users clicked on different tabs, the content panels weren't being displayed correctly.

## Root Causes
1. **Script Loading Issues**: The component JavaScript wasn't being loaded reliably due to the way the script was being added to the DOM.
2. **Tab Activation Logic**: The `activateTab()` method had debugging code that made it overly verbose and less reliable.

## Changes Made

### 1. Script Loading Improvements

**Before**:
- The script was loaded using a DOMContentLoaded event listener
- This created potential timing issues with the minimal-loader.js which also handles script execution
- The script was loaded with `async=true` which could lead to unpredictable loading order

**After**:
- Removed the DOMContentLoaded event listener to avoid conflicts with minimal-loader's execution flow
- Changed `async=false` for more predictable loading order
- Appended the script to document.body instead of document.head for better visibility
- Kept the cache-busting timestamp for development reliability

### 2. activateTab() Method Improvements

**Before**:
- Excessive debugging logs that could impact performance
- Verbose panel identification and activation logic
- Redundant debugging code that wasn't necessary for production

**After**:
- Streamlined the tab activation process
- Simplified the logic for showing/hiding panels
- Added an early return if the tab button isn't found to prevent further errors
- Removed unnecessary debugging code while keeping essential error logs

## Testing Verification
The changes were tested by loading the Ergon component and verifying that:
1. The script is properly loaded (verified in the network tab and console logs)
2. Clicking on tabs correctly displays the associated panels
3. The active tab is visually highlighted with the correct CSS class

## Additional Notes
This fix follows the BEM naming convention pattern established in the Clean Slate Sprint guidelines and ensures proper component isolation.

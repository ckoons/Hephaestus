## Migration Process Checklist

For each component, follow these steps:

### 1. Preparation
- [ ] Review component HTML structure
- [ ] Identify CSS classes to be renamed
- [ ] Document component-specific functionality

### 2. HTML Update
- [ ] Update class names to follow BEM convention
- [ ] Add component-specific prefixes to all classes
- [ ] Ensure HTML is self-contained without dependencies

### 3. CSS Refactoring
- [ ] Move component CSS to dedicated file if not already
- [ ] Update all selectors with component prefixes
- [ ] Apply BEM naming convention to all classes
- [ ] Replace hardcoded values with CSS variables

### 4. JavaScript Update
- [ ] Update DOM selectors to use new class names
- [ ] Implement event delegation pattern
- [ ] Add cleanup handlers for component unloading
- [ ] Remove any document-level DOM queries

### 5. Testing
- [ ] Test component in isolation
- [ ] Verify styles don't leak to other components
- [ ] Test theme switching functionality
- [ ] Verify component state preservation

## Migration Notes

### Core Components
- Component Loader: New file to implement Shadow DOM isolation and component lifecycle
- UI Manager: Needs to be updated to use the new Component Loader

### High Priority Components
- Rhetor: Currently causing UI duplication issues when loaded
- Budget: Currently causing UI duplication issues when loaded

### Medium Priority Components

# Hephaestus UI - Next Implementation Steps

## Core Functionality

1. **Add real WebSocket communication**
   - Replace simulated responses with actual backend communication
   - Implement proper error handling for connection issues
   - Add reconnection logic for dropped connections

2. **Develop component-specific views**
   - Telos: Requirements editor and organizer
   - Athena: Knowledge graph visualization
   - Engram: Memory browser and context management
   - Ergon: Agent creation interface
   - Prometheus: Timeline visualization and planning tools
   - Rhetor: Context management interface
   - Hermes: Message routing dashboard
   - Codex: Code editor integration
   - Harmonia: Orchestration controls
   - Synthesis: Integration workflow editor

## User Interface Enhancements

3. **Implement Budget controls**
   - Cost tracking visualization
   - Budget limit setting interface
   - Approval workflow for high-cost operations
   - Usage analytics dashboard

4. **Add Authentication (if needed)**
   - JWT-based login screen
   - User management
   - Role-based access controls

5. **Create responsive design variants**
   - Tablet layout with collapsible panels
   - Mobile view with essential features
   - Touch optimization for tablet usage

## Chat & Messaging

6. **Enhance chat interface**
   - Clear component attribution for messages
   - Code snippet highlighting with Monaco editor
   - Message threading capability
   - File/image attachment support

7. **Develop real-time status monitoring**
   - Component health indicators
   - Resource usage monitoring
   - Operation status tracking
   - Event notification system

## Configuration & Visualization

8. **Implement Settings page**
   - Theme selection (dark/light)
   - Font size controls
   - Notification preferences
   - Developer mode toggle

9. **Improve error handling**
   - Meaningful error messages
   - Fallback UI states
   - Error recovery workflows
   - Degraded service indicators

10. **Implement visualization tools**
    - D3.js integrations for data visualization
    - Graph representations for component relationships
    - Timeline views for operations
    - Resource usage charts

## Technical Improvements

11. **Performance optimization**
    - Lazy loading of component views
    - Caching strategies for API calls
    - Memory usage optimization
    - Bundle size reduction

12. **Comprehensive testing**
    - Unit tests for UI components
    - Integration tests with backend
    - Browser compatibility testing
    - Accessibility testing

13. **Documentation**
    - Component API documentation
    - User guide
    - Developer documentation
    - Deployment instructionsHere are the next steps for the Hephaestus UI design implementation:

  1. Add real WebSocket communication to connect with the backend components instead of the simulated responses
  2. Develop component-specific views as outlined in the UI Design Document, including:
    - Telos requirements editor
    - Athena knowledge graph visualization
    - Engram memory browser
    - Other specialized component interfaces
  3. Implement the Budget controls with progress bars and approval workflow
  4. Add authentication if needed, with JWT-based login
  5. Create responsive design variants for tablet and mobile viewing
  6. Enhance chat interface with message attribution and code snippet highlighting
  7. Develop real-time component status monitoring to replace the simulated statuses
  8. Add settings page with theme controls and user preferences
  9. Improve error handling with proper error messages and fallback UI states
  10. Implement visualization tools using D3.js for data representations

  The current UI looks good with the requested changes - black background, hexagon icon, component specialties,
  and improved typography. You can commit these changes and continue refining the design in future iterations.

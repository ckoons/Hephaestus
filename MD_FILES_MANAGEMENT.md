# Hephaestus MD Files Management

## Current Status (April 2025)

After reviewing all Markdown files in the Hephaestus directory, here are recommendations for consolidation, removal, or updates:

### Files to Maintain and Update

1. **README.md**
   - Keep as the main entry point documentation
   - Update to reference the new UI_STYLING_GUIDE.md
   - Current content is good, but should add an "Images" section to clarify where UI images should be placed

2. **DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md**
   - Keep as the primary development reference
   - Well-maintained with comprehensive information
   - Update "Next Steps" section to reflect recent UI fixes and image management

3. **UI_STYLING_GUIDE.md**
   - New document that contains crucial styling information
   - Should be referenced from README.md
   - Critical for maintaining consistent UI development practices

### Files to Consolidate or Remove

1. **DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md**
   - **Recommendation: Remove**
   - Content has been addressed in the latest development session
   - Issues with image display and font sizing have been resolved
   - Any remaining valuable information has been moved to UI_STYLING_GUIDE.md

2. **HephaestusRedesign.md**
   - **Recommendation: Archive or consolidate**
   - Contains historical design decisions but much of it is now implemented
   - Consider merging relevant sections into README.md and removing duplicated content
   - The file structure section is outdated compared to the actual implementation

3. **TektonUIOperation.md**
   - **Recommendation: Keep but update**
   - Contains valuable information about AI interaction with UI components
   - Needs updates to reflect current WebSocket implementation
   - The component-specific AI operation section should be updated to match current components

## Recommended Actions

1. **Priority 1: Update CLAUDE.md**
   - Add a section about the recent UI fixes
   - Include notes on browser cache management
   - Reference the new UI_STYLING_GUIDE.md

2. **Priority 2: Remove DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md**
   - Content is no longer relevant after addressing the issues
   - Ensure any valuable content is captured in UI_STYLING_GUIDE.md first

3. **Priority 3: Update README.md**
   - Add reference to UI_STYLING_GUIDE.md
   - Add image management section
   - Update development status section

4. **Priority 4: Consolidate design documentation**
   - Consider merging relevant content from HephaestusRedesign.md into README.md
   - Update TektonUIOperation.md to reflect current implementation

## Timeline and Approach

These document management tasks should be completed before the next major development phase to ensure all team members have access to accurate documentation. The approach should be:

1. Start with updating CLAUDE.md to reflect latest changes
2. Create any new documents needed (already done with UI_STYLING_GUIDE.md)
3. Update existing documentation to reference new documents
4. Remove or archive deprecated documents

This approach ensures no knowledge is lost while streamlining the documentation structure.

# Tekton AI Terminal Implementation Plan

## Instructions for Claude Code Session

Hello Claude Code! Your task is to develop a detailed design and implementation plan for adding AI terminal interfaces to the Tekton UI system. **Important:** This is a planning phase only - you should not make any code changes yet. The implementation will be carried out methodically after this plan is approved.

## Background and Context

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models to solve software engineering problems. The Hephaestus component provides the UI layer. Each Tekton component (Ergon, Prometheus, etc.) has its own AI assistant that will communicate with users through a terminal-like interface in the UI.

## Goals and Requirements

1. Create a terminal-like chat interface for each Tekton component's AI assistant
2. Integrate this interface into the existing Hephaestus UI architecture
3. Connect each terminal UI to its respective AI backend through the Hermes messaging system
4. Implement all necessary WebSocket communication
5. Ensure conversation persistence and context switching
6. Support rich text formatting for AI responses (markdown, code blocks, etc.)

## Step 1: Review Existing Codebase

Start by examining the Tekton codebase structure to understand the current architecture:

1. Review the following key files (do not modify them):
   - `/Hephaestus/ui/index.html` - Main UI structure
   - `/Hephaestus/ui/styles/main.css` - Core styling
   - `/Hephaestus/ui/scripts/main.js` - Core functionality
   - `/Hephaestus/ui/scripts/terminal.js` - Existing terminal implementation
   - `/Hephaestus/ui/scripts/websocket.js` - WebSocket communication
   - `/Hephaestus/ui/components/ergon.html` - Example component UI

2. Pay special attention to these documentation files:
   - `/Hephaestus/TektonUIOperation.md` - ‚≠ê Critical documentation about AI-UI interaction
   - `/Hephaestus/DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md` - Current status and architecture
   - `/Hephaestus/UI_STYLING_GUIDE.md` - Styling guidelines and requirements
   - `/Hephaestus/README.md` - Overview and basic information

## Step 2: Understand the UI Structure

The Tekton UI has the following layout:
- **Left Panel**: Navigation between components (Ergon, Prometheus, etc.)
- **Right Panel**: Main content area with:
  - A header with component title and controls
  - Content area (switches between terminal and HTML panels)
  - Footer with chat input field

Key points to understand:
1. The AI terminal interfaces will be in the right content area
2. The chat input in the footer is shared across all components
3. Each component needs to track and restore context when switching
4. Each component may have multiple tabs, including an AI assistant tab

## Step 3: Design the AI Terminal Interface

Based on your review of the existing codebase, design a terminal-like chat interface for AI interactions that:

1. Has a clean, attractive appearance consistent with the existing UI
2. Supports rich text formatting (markdown, code blocks)
3. Maintains conversation history
4. Scrolls properly when new messages are added
5. Provides visual distinction between user and AI messages
6. Optionally includes typing indicators, timestamps, etc.

## Step 4: Design the WebSocket Communication

Plan the WebSocket communication between the UI and AI backends:

1. Review `/Hephaestus/TektonUIOperation.md` to understand the message protocol
2. Design how the UI will:
   - Send user messages to the correct AI component
   - Receive and display AI responses
   - Handle typing indicators or streaming responses
   - Manage connection errors and reconnection

## Step 5: Design Persistence and Context Switching

Plan how conversation history and user input will be persisted:

1. How chat history will be stored (localStorage, SessionStorage)
2. How draft messages will be saved when switching components
3. How to restore the correct context when returning to a component
4. How to handle component-specific greeting messages

## Step 6: Create a Detailed Implementation Plan

Create a step-by-step implementation plan that includes:

1. **New files** to be created:
   - JavaScript modules
   - CSS files
   - HTML templates

2. **Existing files** to be modified and how

3. **Sequence of implementation steps**:
   - Create HTML structure
   - Implement basic styling
   - Add JavaScript functionality
   - Connect to WebSocket
   - Implement persistence

4. **Testing plan**:
   - How to verify communication works correctly
   - How to test across different components
   - How to validate formatting and appearance

## Expected Output

Your plan should include:

1. A **Component Architecture** diagram or description showing how all pieces fit together
2. **Code snippets** illustrating the key parts of your implementation (HTML, CSS, and JS)
3. A **Timeline and Sequencing** for the changes
4. **Potential challenges** and how to address them
5. A **UI mockup** description of what the chat interface will look like

## Important Considerations

1. **Simplicity**: The implementation should be as simple as possible while meeting requirements
2. **Consistency**: Follow existing patterns in the codebase
3. **Modularity**: Design for independent components that can be tested separately
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure it works in modern browsers
5. **Performance**: Minimize DOM operations and optimize for responsiveness

## Format of Your Analysis

Present your findings and plan in a clear, well-structured format with sections for:

1. **Codebase Analysis**: Summary of what you've learned about the current system
2. **Design Approach**: Your overall approach to solving the problem
3. **Component Design**: Detailed design of new components
4. **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step plan for building the solution
5. **Testing Strategy**: How to verify the implementation works correctly

Remember: **DO NOT implement any code changes yet**. This is only a design and planning phase. The actual implementation will be done methodically with approval at each step.

## Final Notes

Take your time to thoroughly understand the existing codebase before designing your solution. Pay special attention to how the current UI components interact and how the WebSocket communication is handled. The goal is to create a plan that can be implemented incrementally with minimal disruption to the existing system.

## Examples

To help you understand the desired outcome, here are some conceptual examples:

### Example Message Protocol

```javascript
// Send user message to AI
{
  "type": "COMMAND",
  "source": "UI",
  "target": "ergon", // Component ID
  "timestamp": "2025-04-15T12:34:56.789Z",
  "payload": {
    "command": "process_message",
    "message": "How do I create a new agent?"
  }
}

// Receive AI response
{
  "type": "RESPONSE",
  "source": "ergon", // Component ID
  "target": "UI",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-15T12:34:57.789Z",
  "payload": {
    "message": "To create a new agent, you can use the Agents tab or follow these steps:\n\n1. Click the '+ New Agent' button\n2. Fill in the required fields\n3. Select the capabilities you need\n4. Click 'Create'"
  }
}
```

|    workflow.add_step("step1", action)           |
|    ```                                          |
| 4. Save your configuration                      |
|                                                 |
+-------------------------------------------------+
| [Chat Input]                  [Send]            |
+-------------------------------------------------+
```

Good luck with your design! Looking forward to seeing your comprehensive plan.

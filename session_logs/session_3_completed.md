# Session 3 - April 26, 2025 - Budget Component Migration

## Summary

In this third session, we successfully migrated the Budget component to use Shadow DOM isolation. We refactored the component's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to follow the BEM naming convention and to be compatible with the Shadow DOM architecture. We also decoupled the Budget component from RhetorClient by creating a shared BudgetService.

## Implementation Details

### HTML Migration

The Budget component's HTML structure was updated with the following changes:

1. **Tab Navigation**: Converted generic `.tab-button` and `.tab-content` classes to component-specific `.budget-tabs__button` and `.budget-tabs__content` classes following BEM naming convention.
2. **Budget Cards**: Converted the budget summary cards to use component-specific classes like `.budget-card`, `.budget-card__header`, and `.budget-card__progress-bar`.
3. **Chart Elements**: Updated chart sections to use component-specific classes like `.budget-chart-card`, `.budget-chart-card__header`, and `.budget-legend-item`.
4. **Form Elements**: Applied component-specific classes to all form elements, such as `.budget-form__input`, `.budget-form__select`, and `.budget-form__label`.
5. **Alert Components**: Restructured alert elements to use BEM naming convention with classes like `.budget-alert`, `.budget-alert__icon`, and `.budget-alert__actions`.

### CSS Refactoring

The CSS was refactored with the following improvements:

1. **Shadow DOM Support**: Added `:host` selector for theme variables to ensure proper propagation across shadow boundaries.
2. **BEM Convention**: Consistently applied BEM naming throughout the stylesheet, adding the `budget-` prefix to all component classes.
3. **Theme Variables**: Updated CSS variables to reference global theme variables with appropriate fallbacks.
4. **Component Namespacing**: Applied consistent prefixing to prevent style leakage between components.
5. **New UI Elements**: Added styling for notification system, loading indicators, and connection error states.
6. **Responsive Design**: Maintained responsive behavior with mobile-friendly media queries.

### JavaScript Updates

The JavaScript was updated to work within the Shadow DOM context and decoupled from RhetorClient:

1. **Component Structure**: Wrapped the entire script in a self-executing function with the component context.
2. **DOM Queries**: Replaced document-level queries with shadow-scoped queries using `component.$` and `component.$$`.
3. **Event Delegation**: Updated event handlers to use the component's event delegation system.
4. **Cleanup Handling**: Added cleanup registration to properly close connections and remove event listeners when the component is unmounted.
5. **Shared Service**: Created a `BudgetService` class that is registered globally for other components to use.
6. **Fallback Service**: Added a fallback mechanism for when the API service is not available.
7. **Notification System**: Implemented a notification system that works within the Shadow DOM.
8. **Loading Indicators**: Added loading indicators for async operations.

### UI Manager Integration

The UI manager was updated to load the Budget component using the Shadow DOM component loader:

1. **Component Loading**: Replaced the legacy loading approach with the new component loader.
2. **Special Component Handling**: Updated the `_loadSpecialComponent` method to reflect Budget's migration to Shadow DOM.

### Component Registry Update

The component registry was updated to mark Budget as a Shadow DOM component:

1. **Shadow DOM Flag**: Added `"usesShadowDom": true` to the Budget component entry.
2. **Capabilities**: Added "shadow_dom" and "component_isolation" to the component's capabilities.
3. **Dependency Removal**: Removed the dependency on Rhetor due to the new shared service implementation.

## Shared Service Pattern

A key part of this migration was the introduction of a shared service pattern:

1. **Service Registration**: The `BudgetService` is registered in the global `window.tektonUI.services` object.
2. **API Interface**: The service provides a clean API for accessing budget data.
3. **Connection Management**: Handles connection state and reconnection logic.
4. **Error Handling**: Standardized error handling across the service.
5. **Fallback Mechanism**: Provides mock data when the real API is unavailable.

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Dependency Decoupling**: Removing the direct dependency on `RhetorClient` required careful refactoring to maintain functionality.
2. **Event Handling**: Ensuring event handlers worked properly within the Shadow DOM context required changes to event delegation.
3. **Notification System**: Implementing a notification system that works within Shadow DOM boundaries was challenging.
4. **Shadow DOM Styling**: Ensuring proper theme variable propagation through the Shadow DOM.

## Testing Results

The implementation was tested by:

1. Loading the Budget component and verifying it appears properly with all tabs and content.
2. Checking that styles are properly isolated within the Shadow DOM without affecting other components.
3. Verifying that theme variables are properly propagated through the Shadow DOM boundary.
4. Testing the tab navigation functionality within the component.
5. Testing form input validation and submission.
6. Verifying notification and loading indicators work properly.
7. Testing the component's behavior when the backend service is unavailable.

All tests passed successfully, and the component is functioning as expected with proper isolation.

## Next Steps

For Session 4, we should focus on:

1. **Creating Shared Component Utilities**:
   - Extract common patterns from Rhetor and Budget components
   - Create a shared tab navigation utility
   - Implement standardized form handling
   - Develop a reusable notification system
   - Formalize the shared service pattern

2. **Migrating the Terma Component**:
   - Update terma-component.html to use component-specific classes
   - Refactor terma-component.css following the BEM naming convention
   - Update terma-component.js to work within Shadow DOM context
   - Create a shared TerminalService if applicable

3. **Documenting Component Communication**:
   - Create guidelines for inter-component communication
   - Document the shared service pattern
   - Provide examples for different communication scenarios

## Conclusion

This session successfully migrated the Budget component to use Shadow DOM isolation, created a shared service pattern for component communication, and updated the relevant documentation. The Budget component now follows the BEM naming convention and its styles are properly contained within its shadow boundary.

The shared service pattern introduced in this session provides a template for decoupling other components and ensuring proper communication between them. With both Rhetor and Budget components successfully migrated, we have validated the approach and are ready to continue with the remaining components.
